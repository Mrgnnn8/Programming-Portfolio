About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate and driven Python developer with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and software development. I’m currently finishing my Business and Management degree, but my true passion lies in the world of technology and artificial intelligence. With a deep curiosity about how data can be used to solve complex problems, I have developed a range of projects that showcase my skills in both coding and problem-solving.

I have experience working with a variety of tools and libraries including Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost. I also have hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, linear regression, and support vector machines, and I have applied these models to real-world datasets in domains such as finance and gaming.

My portfolio includes:

Crossy Road-Style Game: A Python game using the Turtle module, where I enhanced the gameplay with AI elements, such as lane-changing behavior and acceleration towards the player. The game also includes a high score tracker to monitor the player's best performance.

Mail Merger: A Python-based automation tool that generates personalized emails using user-provided data and a template.

U.S. States Namer Game: A fun, interactive Python game where users guess the names of U.S. states based on a map.

Student Exam Score Predictor: A machine learning project that predicts student exam scores using linear regression and evaluates the model’s performance using MAE and R-squared metrics.

Nvidia Stock Price Predictor: A machine learning model that predicts the future stock prices of Nvidia using historical data and various financial indicators.

My goal is to continue honing my skills in AI/ML, cloud computing, and backend development, and eventually pursue a career as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or an AI/IT consultant. I enjoy taking on challenges, building innovative solutions, and learning new techniques to improve my work.
