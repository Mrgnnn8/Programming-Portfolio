Welcome to My Code Portfolio!
Hello! I'm a passionate and driven Python developer with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and software development. I’m currently finishing my Business and Management degree, but my true passion lies in the world of technology and artificial intelligence. With a deep curiosity about how data and AI can solve complex problems, I have developed a range of projects that showcase my skills in coding, problem-solving, and application development.

I have experience working with a variety of tools and libraries including Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost. I also have hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, linear regression, and support vector machines, and I have applied these models to real-world datasets in domains such as finance and gaming. Recently, I’ve expanded my skills to include building AI-powered applications using APIs.

My portfolio includes:

- Productivity Assistant Chatbot: The project demonstrates skills in AI integration, Python programming, data analysis, and user-centric design while overcoming challenges like data integration and AI fine-tuning. This bot highlights AI's potential to optimise personal productivity.

- Crossy Road-Style Game: A Python game using the Turtle module, enhanced with AI elements such as lane-changing behavior and dynamic reactions based on the player’s position. The game includes a high score tracker to monitor player performance.

- Mail Merger: A Python-based automation tool that generates personalized emails using user-provided data and a template, demonstrating skills in file handling and string manipulation.

- Student Exam Score Predictor: A machine learning project that predicts student exam scores using linear regression and evaluates the model’s performance with metrics like MAE and R-squared.

- Nvidia Stock Price Predictor: A machine learning model that forecasts Nvidia's future stock prices based on historical data and various financial indicators, using algorithms like Random Forests to analyze trends.

My Vision
My goal is to continue honing my skills in AI/ML, cloud computing, and backend development, and eventually pursue a career as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or an AI/IT consultant. I enjoy taking on challenges, building innovative solutions, and learning new techniques to improve my work. Whether it’s through gaming, automation, or predictive modeling, I’m committed to creating impactful projects that make a difference.
