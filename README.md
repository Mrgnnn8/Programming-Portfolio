Welcome to My Code Portfolio!
Hello! I'm a passionate and driven Python developer with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and software development. I’m currently finishing my Business and Management degree, but my true passion lies in the world of technology and artificial intelligence. With a deep curiosity about how data and AI can solve complex problems, I have developed a range of projects that showcase my skills in coding, problem-solving, and application development.

I have experience working with a variety of tools and libraries including Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost. I also have hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, linear regression, and support vector machines, and I have applied these models to real-world datasets in domains such as finance and gaming. Recently, I’ve expanded my skills to include building AI-powered applications using APIs.

My portfolio includes:

Claude AI Chat Application: A Python-based GUI chatbot that integrates Anthropic's Claude API to simulate conversations with an AI assistant. Built using Tkinter for the interface, the app features real-time interaction, error handling, chat history management, and the secure use of API keys via environment variables.

Crossy Road-Style Game: A Python game using the Turtle module, enhanced with AI elements such as lane-changing behavior and dynamic reactions based on the player’s position. The game includes a high score tracker to monitor player performance.

Mail Merger: A Python-based automation tool that generates personalized emails using user-provided data and a template, demonstrating skills in file handling and string manipulation.

U.S. States Namer Game: A fun, interactive Python game where users guess the names of U.S. states based on a map. Correct guesses appear above their respective states, and missed states are saved in a file for future practice.

Student Exam Score Predictor: A machine learning project that predicts student exam scores using linear regression and evaluates the model’s performance with metrics like MAE and R-squared.

Nvidia Stock Price Predictor: A machine learning model that forecasts Nvidia's future stock prices based on historical data and various financial indicators, using algorithms like Random Forests to analyze trends.

My Vision
My goal is to continue honing my skills in AI/ML, cloud computing, and backend development, and eventually pursue a career as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or an AI/IT consultant. I enjoy taking on challenges, building innovative solutions, and learning new techniques to improve my work. Whether it’s through gaming, automation, or predictive modeling, I’m committed to creating impactful projects that make a difference.
